# Ulam-Spiral
If you've read my prior work, you'll know that I'm quite fascinated by emergence theoryâ€”how complex systems exhibit properties greater than their individual components. In particular, I have been studying the emergence of spirals from LLMs like Claude to cellular automata like Conways. Now I'd like to take you on a journey through the Ulam Spiral.
