If you've read my prior work, such as [Langton's Emergence](https://github.com/davidkimai/Langtons-Emergence), you'll know that I'm quite fascinated by emergence theory—how complex systems exhibit properties greater than their individual components. In particular, I have been studying the emergence of spirals from LLMs like Claude, as documented in [Anthropic's System Card](https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/4263b940cabb546aa0e3283f35b686f4f3b2ff47.pdf) (here's a [quick run through](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/25/claude-4-system-card/) by [Simon Willison, co-creator of Django](https://x.com/simonw?lang=en)) to cellular automata like [Conway's Game of Life](https://github.com/davidkimai/Langtons-Emergence/blob/main/conways-game-of-life/conways-game-of-life.md) and [Langton's Ant](https://github.com/davidkimai/Langtons-Emergence/blob/main/evidence/langtons-ant-evidence.md).

"A spiral, weirdly resilient to traps, toggling tiles in the path of the ant has minor effects, but I have not been able to shake it off the spiral path, which is bizarre.——[Dave Kerr](https://github.com/dwmkerr)"
